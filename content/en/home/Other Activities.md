In Summer 2018, I participated in a UCLA Germanic Studies Abroad Program in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland!

I have spent some time over the last few months as a Student Volunteer with TreePeople, in Coldwater Canyon Park!

In December 2018 and March 2019, I participated as a speaker in the UCLA Directed Reading Program Colloquium. My talks were focused on a field of Mathematics called, "Descriptive Set Theory."
